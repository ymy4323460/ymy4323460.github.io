This is a story about talent, effort, and whether someone like me could ever really do research.

Recently, after many long conversations with friends, colleagues, and my own students, I felt I should write something for myself, and maybe for anyone who is stuck in a difficult place.

When I was young, I always told people I wanted to be a scientist. Everyone around me would say, “You’re a bit smart, but real scientists need talent.” I spent years wondering what “talent” even meant, arguing with people, trying to prove I had it. But the truth is: I never had the grades or achievements that could convince anyone.

There were so many setbacks. Failing the college entrance exam, failing the postgraduate exam, locking myself at home to prepare another year, and finally having to face the painful truth that I wasn’t “qualified” to talk about dreams at all.

Other people’s doubt was hard, but my own disappointment was worse. It completely shattered my sense of direction.

Maybe my biggest mistake was thinking someone who kept stumbling had no right to dream.

But in that darkest moment, every emotion in my head condensed into one belief:
I don’t want a life with no choices. Keep going. Don’t give up.

That belief is what pulled me out of every low point. Every step hurt, because every step meant tearing apart some piece of my ignorance, naïveté, or fear. I read endlessly, stayed up countless nights, forced myself from closed-off to open, from passive to proactive.

And slowly, unbelievably, I went from unnoticed to recognized, and spent more than a decade finding my way back to the path I once dreamed of.

So what is “talent”?
I finally have my own answer:
Talent is the refusal to give up. Talent is belief and effort, repeated endlessly.

A genius may walk the path in one year; I may need three. But if we walk long enough, our roads can still meet at the same horizon. Maybe I won’t reach the final destination, but the point is to keep walking.

Fourteen years ago, in high school, my only dream was to study at USTC and become a physicist. The road there was long. Fourteen years long. And when my student life finally ended, I stepped onto that campus for the first time — not as a physics student, but as an assistant professor guest.

And I didn’t become a physicist.
But I’m not sad; that dream carried me all the way here.

I made it this far.
And if you start from a higher place than I did, you absolutely can too.
