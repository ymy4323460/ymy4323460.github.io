I am currently a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor in the US) at the School of [Engineering Mathematics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/eng-maths-tech/), University of Bristol. I obtained my PhD from University College London (UCL), advised by Professor [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/).

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning and Causality, with a particular focus on causal world models. If you are interested in discussing potential collaborations or shared research interests, please feel free to contact me at yangmy6750@gmail.com.
