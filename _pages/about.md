I'm currently a Lecturer (= US Assistant Professor) at the School of [Engineering Mathematics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/eng-maths-tech/) at the University of Bristol. I studied for my PhD in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ucl-computer-science) at University College London (UCL), advised by Professor [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). 

My research interests include Reinforcement Learning and Causality, with a particular focus on causality in world models. If you would like to discuss potential collaboration or common interests, please feel free to reach me at yangmy6750@gmail.com.
