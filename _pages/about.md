I'm a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ucl-computer-science) at University College London (UCL), advised by Professor [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). I was a research intern at ByteDance Research and DIDI AI Labs. Prior to UCL, I received my M.Sc. from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

My research interests are Reinforcement Learning, Multi-agent Systems and Causality. If you would like to chat about potential collaboration or common interests, feel free to reach me at mengyue.yang.20@ucl.ac.uk.

I will be joining the school of engineering, mathematics and technology at University of Bristol as lecturer (= US assistant professor).
