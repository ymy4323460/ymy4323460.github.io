Beyond research, I’m a game fan with a strong interest in strategy games that require careful planning, resource management, and long-term thinking. Some of my all-time favorites include Civilization and Crusader Kings. These games not only entertain but also reflect my love for complex systems, cause–effect dynamics, and decision-making, themes that interestingly overlap with my academic interests.

Outside of strategy, I also enjoy other genres such as League of Legends and open-world adventure games, where creativity, exploration, and teamwork come together to shape immersive experiences.

More recently, I’ve begun learning chess as a complete beginner. It’s a humbling yet fascinating journey into a timeless game of logic and foresight. I’m currently playing and learning on Chess.com (username: yangmy6750). If you’re also a chess enthusiast, whether a beginner like me or a seasoned player — I’d love to connect, play a few games, or exchange insights. Always happy to learn from others and improve together!

Games I played and recommend:

A. Strategic Games： Civilization, Crusader Kings III, Two Point Hospital, Don’t Starve, 7 Days to Die

B. Narrative Games: What Remains of Edith Finch, Late Shift, Detroit: Become Human, Nier: Automata, Final Fantasy XIII, 仙剑 4–7, Rusty Lake series

C. Action & Open-World Adventure: Black Myth: Wukong, Dying Light, Outlast II, Devil May Cry 4 & 5, Trine series, Yanyun Sixteen Voices

D. MOBA, Team-Based: League of Legends

E. Anime-style Open World: Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Honkai Impact 3rd, Honkai 2
