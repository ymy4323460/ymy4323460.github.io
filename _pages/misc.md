## Misc.

Beyond research, I'm a game fan with a strong interest in strategy games that require careful planning, resource management, and long-term thinking. Some of my all-time favorites include *Civilization*, *Crusader Kings*, and *Europa Universalis*. These games not only entertain but also reflect my love for complex systems, cause-effect dynamics, and decision-making — themes that interestingly overlap with my academic interests.

More recently, I’ve begun learning chess as a complete beginner. It’s a humbling yet fascinating journey into a timeless game of logic and foresight. I'm currently playing and learning on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/yangmy6750) (username: **yangmy6750**). If you're also a chess enthusiast — whether a beginner like me or a seasoned player — I’d love to connect, play a few games, or exchange insights. Always happy to learn from others and improve together!
